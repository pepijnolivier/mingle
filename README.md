As you may already know, [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com/) is a full-stack framework for [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) that allows you to build dynamic interfaces using server-side code.
MingleJS allows you to use React/Vue components in your Livewire application, so you can use the best of both worlds.

## How is it working?

MingleJS renders a `div` on the server-side, and then mounts the React/Vue component on the client-side. Each JS component is rendered by a Livewire compoenent, so you get an island of interactivity in your Livewire application, with the JS of your taste.

## Some included nicety features

In the backend component, you can pass data that the component will have access to on the frontend.

You can choose to keep using Ajax client - Axios/Fetch/etc.
But the reality is, for the most part, you can use the convenient way of making server actions, which is Livewire. You get to make server requests just by `$wire.addTodo(todo)`. Find below a simple diagram of how MingleJS works in a page.
